// Boundary semantics:
//   - today, week and month are PERIOD-TO-DATE: Start is a local-midnight
//     boundary (today's midnight / most-recent-Monday midnight / the 1st of the
//     month) and Stop is the caller-supplied "now". These windows therefore
//     normally cover a partial day.
//   - custom is an arbitrary explicit range: Start and Stop are exactly the
//     caller-supplied from/to.

// ResolveWindow turns a window spec into a half-open [Start, Stop) range.
//
// It is pure and clock-driven: now is supplied by the caller (sourced from the
// injected Clock) and ResolveWindow never calls time.Now() itself. loc is the
// timezone the calendar boundaries are computed in (Europe/London in prod);
// week starts Monday.
//
// Spec handling:
//   - "today": Start = local midnight of now's date in loc; Stop = now.
//   - "week":  Start = most recent Monday 00:00 local (if now is a Monday, that
//     is today's midnight); Stop = now.
//   - "month": Start = the 1st of now's month at 00:00 local; Stop = now.
//   - "custom": requires both from and to non-zero; Start = from, Stop = to.
//     Errors if either is missing or if to <= from.
//   - any other spec is an error.
//
// Local midnights are built with time.Date(y, m, d, 0,0,0,0, loc) so DST is
// handled correctly: a London "day" may be 23h (spring forward) or 25h (autumn
// back) across the clock change, and the resulting Start carries the correct
// UTC offset for its date (00:00 local is 23:00 UTC in BST, 00:00 UTC in GMT).
